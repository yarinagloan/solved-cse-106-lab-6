Serve the web application you developed in Lab 5 as a Flask app and create a REST API in Flask for it. Have the front end you developed in Lab 5 make calls to your API instead of the public API. In other words, this lab will look the same as the previous one but will use your REST API instead of amhep.pythonanywhere.com and Flask will serve your front end code, so it can be accessed through a URL (e.g. localhost:5000) instead of your hard drive. By way of reminder, your program and REST API should:

<ul>

 <li>Allow a user to ask for a grade from the backend and display the grade, given the student name</li>

 <li>Allow the user to see all students and grades</li>

 <li>Allow a user to create a new student name and grade in the backend</li>

 <li>Allow a user to edit a grade in the backend</li>

 <li>Allow a user to delete a grade in the backend</li>

</ul>
